The weeks are swifting like they on the highway! Week 3 has been a great week,feels like it has been a productive week, along side with the previous weeks.Starting off the week we had another great literature session with Dr.Pandey. This week I covered part of NumPy tutorial, it was in fact, a great week wrapping up NumPy, I feel like I enjoyed doing Numpy than the Python syntax I did last week. Some interesting things about NumPy is that it faster than the other python libraries. This wwek, I had to do more on my own sessions, just by taking notes and then my mentor would go over it and that actually helps me to interpret and have a better understanding from it. I guess it is always going to take someone that already experienced this field for you to feel on point and feel like you are heading somewhere. Not going to lie, at one point I got over excited, because I am like yea this is fun and I am getting it, but only to know that I misunderstand something. So I will try not to be so over excited and try to have more of a open mind in this season.One of this week's assignment was to post comments on the discussion board about other group progress of the week, that was great as well. It is amazing to see everyone staying on top of their game and progressing perfectly throughout these weeks. Recapping this week, I also went over four other literature papers, that was interesting as well; just by comparing and to actually see the different models/techniques that has been used to detect disease detection in different plants.During this week also, our mentor went over Image processing and using open CV. We grasp the understanding of how to change different color of a image, also how to import a image to NumPy. The week continued to be an interesting week whereas we went to a field trip to John Hopkins University. It was a very informative and intersting trip. For the first time I get to witness a robot Dog, I mean like I only had the priviledge to have seen those in movies. So this week, has been a very fun and interesting one. I love that for myself, because this is a new field for me and I am thankful that I am keeping up and learning more and more new things as the days progresses.
