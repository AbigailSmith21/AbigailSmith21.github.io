Yea! Week 4, Before I approached this week, I did some homework on the weekend. On Monday, we did our literature session with Dr.Pandey as usual and we also had a guest speaker whom  emphasizes on Artificial Intelligence. Also, it was a very interesting day, because we got the opportunity to meet the newest participant in the our team-high school teacher. As it relates to our high school teacher (Ronald Saul), his primary field is in science and he has fourteen (14) years of experienced in teaching. With that, I feel like he will reflect a positive and great impact in our group. As the day proceeds, we went on and completed two literature papers. So now in total each of us have reviewed ten (10) literature papers, that is exciting because we are in week 4, and I feel like that is a big accomplishment.


In addition, we continued on NumPy, more like revising for me, because as I stated earlier that I did homework over the weekend. So, I was already gone over what was already being revised. It was somewhat of a great impact for me either way, because I gained more knowledge and understanding. The review was mostly of different Data distributions methods using NumPy. Moreover, to wrap off the day, we had a session with Dr. Saroj regarding Plants and Animals where he talked in-depth about Plant tissues. For the following day, we celebrated Juneteenth, so we got a day off from work, however, I tried to continue and completed the Panda's tutorial.


Furthermore, I did not get to go to NASA unfortunately, but I had more of a productive day, as well as a relaxing day in the lab. For this session, I went over the OpenCV tutorial and gained more understanding on that. Also, I made  sure that I gave my reviews of different videos submissions on canvas. It felt like a fast week; I think Juneteenth had that impact and then the trip to NASA, but I believe I was able to overcome and accomplish the different tasks/ assignments for this week. In fact, prior to my progress thus far, now I am looking forward to a great upcoming week, have a good one.
