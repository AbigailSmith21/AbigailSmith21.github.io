 Yea! Week 4, Before I approached this week, I did some homework on the weekend. 
 On Monday, we did our literature session with Dr.Pandey as usual and we also had a guest speaker whom emphasizes on Artificial Intelligence.
 Also, it was a very interesting day, because we got the opportunity to meet our high school teacher. As it relates to our high school teacher (Ronald Saul), his primary field is in science and he has fourteen(14) years of experienced in teaching. With that, I feel like he will reflect a positive and great impact in our group. As the day proceeds, we went on and completed two literature papers. So now in total we have ten(10) literature papers, that is exciting because we are in week 4, and I feel like that is a big accomplishment. 


 In addition, We continued on NumPy, more like revising for me, because as I stated earlier that I did homework over the weekend. So I was already gone over what was already being revised. It was somewhat of a great impact for me either way, because I gain more knowledge and understanding. The review was mostly consist of different distributions using NumPy. Moreover, to wrap off the day, we had a session with Dr. Saroj regarding Plants and Animals. 
 For the following day, we celebrated Juneteeth, so we got a day off from work, however, I tried to continued and completed Pandas tutorial. 


 Furthermore, I did not get to go to NASA unfortunately, but I had more of a productive day,as well as a relaxing day in the lab. For this session, I went over OpenCV tutorial and gain more understanding on that. Also, make sure that I did my reviews on different videos on canvas. It felt like a fast week; I think Juneteenth had that impact and then the trip to NASA , but I believe I was able to overcome and accomplished the different task/ assignments for this week.Looking forward for a great upcoming week, have a good one.
