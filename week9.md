  Penultimate week completed! Iâ€™m grateful for this opportunity and the progress we've made so far. The week began with a NSA session, which was engaging and offered valuable insights from various speakers.

  Throughout the week, I focused on continuously training the CNN model, editing our comprehensive paper, and preparing our presentation slides. The most challenging part was training on different datasets; it was a struggle as it took hours to train just one class.

  These efforts are part of our preparations for the final week of presentation and deliveries. Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
