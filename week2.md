Oh Wow! Second week already! 
I am delighted that I made it thus far. As it relates to my project updates; I think that my team and I are on the right track. This week we went over various backgrounds regarding our topic (Plant Leaf Disease Detection in Fruit Cultivvation with Machine Learning Models).
In my group we continued to learn more on pyhton through www.w3schools.com(Python Syntax) Which helps alot. Also, I am thankful to have my mentor(Blessing) by our sides for each step regardless of her difficulties to not being with us physically. 
Additionally, within our group we reviewed our different sources that we had put together from last week, more so trying to figure out what is the best model/prefernce is best for our project.Along side that we did backgroud research and connecting with your project topic with Dr. Saroj who teaches in that field. I also, completed my CITI program assignment throughout the course of this week.
