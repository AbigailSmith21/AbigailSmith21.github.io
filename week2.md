Oh Wow! Second week already! 
I am delighted that I made it thus far. As it relates to my project updates; I think that my team and I are on the right track. This week we went over various backgrounds regarding our topic (Plant Leaf Disease Detection in Fruit Cultivvation with Machine Learning Models).
In my group we continued to learn more on pyhton through www.w3schools.com(Python Syntax) Which helps alot. Some of the different things we went over was things like the different data types,different operators,diverse functions, Python Syntax, Booleans.Going through these different new terms at first it was not so fun, but I actually enjoyed learning and understanding the different concepts.The part I enjoyed the most was identifying the differemt data types and applying the new functions that I learnt about. Also, I am thankful to have my mentor(Blessing) by our sides for each step regardless of her difficulties to not being with us physically. 
Additionally, within our group we reviewed our different literature papers that we had already discovered from last week. So for this week we reviewed the diverse to try figure out what is the best model that we can use to proceed into our project. Along side that we did backgroud research and connecting with your project topic with Dr. Saroj who teaches in that field. Dr. Saroj did a great job on explaining ideal definitions on Plants and Diseases. He also emphasize about how different diseases looks in plants.Moreover, to to wrap the week off, I completed my Citi Program training assignment.
