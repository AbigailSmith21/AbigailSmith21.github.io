Yay! Halfway through! First and foremost, I want to acknowledge God for allowing me to progress this far into the program. This week started a bit differently. Normally, we begin our week with a morning session with Dr. Pandey, but this time we spent all our time in the lab. The week began on an exciting note as we dove into coding. Initially, it was a bit challenging, because the previous weeks we focused mostly on theory and basic concepts in NumPy and Pandas.

However, we started working with dataframes and datasets, trying to figure out the appropriate codes to complete our assignments. Even after doing some research, I didn't fully understand everything. Fortunately, I shared my work with my mentor, and together we analyzed and fixed the problems. What began as a unsettling task turned into a valuable learning experience, and I gained a much better understanding.

As the days went on, it became more of an exploratory day for me. I delved into different coding concepts on the internet and watched various tutorials on different aspects of Python. These tutorials helped me grasp the key terms used in Python, and everything started to make sense. I began to feel comfortable again. After all, facing challenges and overcoming them is a rewarding experience.

Throughout the rest of the week, I mostly worked on literature reviews and the introduction for my paper. This was quite interesting, because I could compare and contrast the ten papers I had reviewed, identifying their different limitations and research gaps. Reviewing them all in one sitting allowed me to gain a deeper understanding, which I initially struggled with. This has been a great and incredibly productive week 5, showing progress in various areas.

Thank you for staying up to date with my weekly report. Have a good one!
