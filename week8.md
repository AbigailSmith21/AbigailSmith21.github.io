Yay! Another week wrapped up! Thank you, Lord, for this opportunity. I'm getting used to how quickly the weeks are flying by. Here's a brief rundown of my accomplishments and challenges for this week:

I started the week by working on the methodology and abstract for our comprehensive paper. To finish the day, we began working on our pitch video and completed it. Throughout the rest of the week, we focused on training the CNN model using a broader dataset.

This task took some time because, at first, I was doing it the long way by trying to download the dataset, which took forever. After hours of waiting, my mentor (Miss Blessing) suggested using the API format, which turned out to be much easier and faster. With my mentor's help, I was able to smoothly proceed with training the model.

Additionally, we worked on our slides. I spent time brainstorming and jotting down ideas as a rough draft while anticipating the final presentation template. We also delved deeper into the YoloV9 model and continued editing our websites.

It was a comprehensive and busy week, but we are making steady progress, which is the most important thing.

Thank you for reading, and have a great one!
