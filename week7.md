Seventh week in the bag! This week has been quite interesting. I started off with a strong mentality, which I felt was very important. I continued training and hyperparameter tuning on the CNN model and began researching the YOLOv9 model.

Additionally, my team and I worked on creating a flow chart for our entire project. Most of this week was dedicated to continuously training and researching CNN and YOLOv9 models.

We also learned about our upcoming mid-summer presentation, so my team and I began working on the web design for our project and prepared a final demo.

Our presentation went exceptionally well, and the following day, we resumed researching and implementing YOLOv9. I assisted my team members with the web design.

That wraps up the week. Later today, we will complete our group report and continue working on YOLOv9. Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
