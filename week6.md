Another week in the bagâ€”thankfully! This week was much more interesting than the previous ones. We continued our work on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), exploring various tutorials and applying the concepts we learned. Additionally, I watched and took notes on Data Science.

On Tuesday, I assisted my team members in preparing for our presentation, spending the entire day working on our PowerPoint slides. Although we were scheduled to present on Wednesday, it was unfortunately delayed. However, we continued our work on CNN models the following day.

The week flew by, mainly because my team and I were deeply focused on our project and also due to the July 4th holiday. One of the highlights was that my mentor finally arrived from her country, which was incredibly exciting.

That wraps up this week. Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
